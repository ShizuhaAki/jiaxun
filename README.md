# Jiaxun
This is a virtual repo that combines both frontend and backend code as submodules.

## Installation

After installing, clone the repository and build it
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ShizuhaAki/jiaxun
make install-dependencies
make dev    # or make production for the production server
```

> [!warning]
> Do not attempt to directly run the frontend, because the client library is generated and thus not included in the Git repository.
